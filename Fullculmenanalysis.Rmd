## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, echo=TRUE} 
### In this data analysis I will attempt to assess the difference in the culmen length, or the length of the dorsal ridge of the upper beak mandible, between three species of penguin. These species are the Adelie penguin, Chinstrap penguin and Gentoo penguin. Data was collected at the Palmer Station, Antarctica, by Dr. Kristen Gormer. 

### I hypothesise that species which consume higher levels of krill in their diet will have lower culmen lengths than those which feed more on fish, as longer beaks enable for more effective spearing and catching of larger prey. Therefore, I hypothesize that the Adelie penguin, which mostly eats krill (Tabassum, 2022), will have the shortest culmen length, whereas the Gentoo penguin, which eats the largest proportion of fish and squid (Clausen and Putz, 2003), will have the longest beak length.

#Here I am loading the packages relevant to this data analysis, including ggplot2 for creating graphical figures, and the palmerpenguins dataset to analyse   

write.csv(penguins_raw, "data/penguins_raw.csv")

source("functions/cleaning.r") 
#Here I am loading a list of functions from another R document that will assist me in cleaning my data. For example, a function tiled 'remove_NA' that will remove results listed as non-applicable in the dataset, which could otherwise affect my data analysis

    shorten_species() %>%
    remove_empty_columns_rows()
#Here I am using some of the functions I loaded in order to make the raw penguins dataset more readable, including shortening species names to no longer include scientific names, and removing empty columns or rows from the dataset 

write.csv(penguins_clean, "data/penguins_clean.csv") 
#Here I am saving my cleaned data to my data folder

names(penguins_clean) 
#This line of code enables me to check the data cleaning process has properly edited the dataset column titles, and shows me what the titles now are 

culmen_length_data <- penguins_clean %>%
    subset_columns(c("culmen_length_mm", "species","sex")) %>%
    remove_NA() 
#Here I am using more functions from the loaded R document, this time for example in order to subset the data into the different penguin species, allowing for comparison across species of culmen length 

head(culmen_length_data) 
#This line of code allows me to inspect the column headings from the dataset involved in the culmen length analysis, allowing me to identify any problems with the way the data has now been formatted 

``` 

```{r, echo=TRUE} 
set.seed(0) #Ensuring the random point generation is the same for anyone who runs this code
culmen_violin <- ggplot(data = culmen_length_data, 
                          aes(x = species, 
                              y = culmen_length_mm)) +
                          geom_violin(aes(color = species)) + #Creating a violin plot using species and culmen length data from the dataset 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Adelie" = "coral1", "Chinstrap" = "aquamarine2", "Gentoo" = "darkgreen")) + #Assigning a specific colour to each species
  geom_jitter(aes(color = species, alpha = 0.25)) +

  theme(legend.position = "none") #Labeling the axes in a readable way, giving the graph a black and white colour scheme, and removing the legend

dev.off() #Saving my properly scaled figure into a folder where it can be easily opened and read

###Now creating a dot plot showing means and confidence intervals for culmen length 
culmen_dotplot <- ggplot(data = culmen_length_data, 
                          aes(x = species, 
                              y = culmen_length_mm), fill = species) +
                          geom_point(aes(color = species), size = 1.25) + 
    scale_color_manual(values = c("Adelie" = "coral1", "Chinstrap" = "aquamarine2", "Gentoo" = "darkgreen")) + #Producing a dot plot and editing the aesthetics of dot colour and size
  stat_summary(fun.data= mean_cl_normal, geom = "crossbar", position = position_dodge(width = 0.1), width = 0.5) + #Analysing the means and confidence intervals for culmen length of each species, and adding this to the figure
  labs(x = "Species", y = "Culmen length (mm)") +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
agg_png("Figures/culmen_dotplot", width = 20, height = 20, units = "cm", res = 500, scaling = 1) 
culmen_dotplot 
dev.off()  
print(culmen_dotplot) 
``` 

```{r, echo = TRUE} 
#I will now perform a pairwise t-test to find out if the differences in culmen length between species are significant or not 
pairwise_test_results <- pairwise.t.test(penguins_clean$culmen_length_mm, penguins_clean$species) 
agg_png("Figures/pairwise_test_results", width = 20, height = 20, units = "cm", res = 500, scaling = 1) 
dev.off()
print(pairwise_test_results) #This will produce a table showing levels of significance in differences in culmen length between species
``` 

```{r, echo = TRUE} 
###Discussion 
#Initially by looking at the violin plot it appeared that Adelie penguins had significantly lower culmen lengths than Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins. This was further suggested by the dot plot which showed significantly differing means, but also suggested a potentially significant difference between Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins, something not clear on the violin plot. Further statistical analysis using a pairwise t-test showed significant differences at the 0.5% level in culmen length between all three species, with Adelie having the lowest and Chinstrap having the highest. 

#To conclude, this supports my hypothesis that Adelie penguins would have the shortest culmen length based on diet. However it does not support my hypothesis that Gentoo penguins have the longest, as Chinstrap penguins, which eat larger proportions of krill, had significantly longer culmen lengths. Therefore I suggest that culmen length is a result of more than one lifestyle factor, not solely diet. Further studies with a larger data set could attempt to find if such factors exist, and whether they cause significant differences in culmen length.
